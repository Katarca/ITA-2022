            JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create
            dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images,
            and pretty much everything else.(Okay, not everything, but it is
            amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)

        <h2>About JS</h2>
        <p class="body-text-black">
          JavaScript, often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is
          one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
          CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for
          web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All
          major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the
          code on users' devices.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text-dark-grey">
          JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that
          conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing,
          prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is
          multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative
          programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs)
          for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data
          structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
        </p>
        <p class="body-text-dark-grey">
          The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such
          as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web
          browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text-dark-grey">
          JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are
          now core components of some servers and a variety of applications. The
          most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text-dark-grey">
          Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and
          respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and
          differ greatly in design.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p class="body-text-white">
          JavaScript was created at Netscape Communications by Brendan Eich in
          1995. Netscape and Eich designed JavaScript as a scripting language
          for use with the company's flagship web browser, Netscape Navigator.
          Initially known as LiveScript, Netscape changed the name to JavaScript
          so they could position it as a companion for the Java language, a
          product of their partner, Sun Microsystems. Apart from some
          superficial syntactic similarities, though, JavaScript is in no way
          related to the Java programming language.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text-grey">
          After its release, more and more browsers started adding JavaScript
          support. Still, for much of its history JavaScript was not regarded as
          a serious programming language. Its earliest releases suffered from
          notable performance and security issues, but developers had no
          alternatives. If they wanted to run programs in the browser, they had
          to use JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text-grey">
          In 2008, the creation of Google's open-source Chrome V8, a
          high-performance JavaScript engine, provided a crucial turning point
          for JavaScript. The subsequent proliferation of fast JavaScript
          engines made it possible for developers to build sophisticated
          browser-based applications with performance that competed with desktop
          and mobile applications.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text-grey">
          Soon after, Ryan Dahl released an open-source, cross-platform
          environment called Node.js. It provided a way to run JavaScript code
          from outside a browser. It freed JavaScript from the browser's
          confines and led directly to JavaScript's current popularity. Today,
          you can use JavaScript to write all kinds of applications, including
          browser, server, mobile, and desktop applications. Most major online
          companies today, including Facebook, Twitter, Netflix, and Google, all
          use JavaScript in their products.

        <h2>JS Today</h2>
        <p class="body-text-white">
          JavaScript has come a long way since its original implementation: it
          took a mere 10 days to write it. The JavaScript standard, proposed for
          the first time as ECMAScript 1 in 1997, is, as of late 2018, in its
          9th iteration (ES 2018). The differences between the specifications
          described in ECMAScript 1 and ES 2018 are immense: they seem to
          describe different languages. In the intervening years, JavaScript has
          undergone massive changes. Not everyone agreed with every change, but,
          taken together, they made JavaScript a more robust, secure, and
          expressive language.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text-grey">
          The JavaScript community of today is arguably the most active
          community in programming. It sometimes seems that every week sees
          releases of new tools, frameworks, and libraries. There are
          preprocessors and transpilers of all sorts available, ranging from
          programs that translate modern JavaScript programs so older JavaScript
          engines can run them, to compiling entirely new languages with
          JavaScript. The JavaScript standard itself is a continuously evolving
          document, with improvements introduced at a rapid rate. JavaScript
          engines incorporate the changes almost as rapidly. New operating
          systems under development (e.g., Google's Fuchsia) are adding support
          for the development of native applications in JavaScript. All of this
          means that JavaScript has an exciting future. It's a great time to
          learn JavaScript!
